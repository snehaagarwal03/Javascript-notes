# DOM and BOM

DOM manipulation with JS - automate whatever you like on webpage with help of it. Automation of login, download data in PDF, Excel. Yes there are some open source tools for that like puppeteer and crawlee help you to easify the task but we will study how its done, how we attach our code with HTML and create an element like h1 or anything and add remove anything in that.

## Script Tag Paths

| Path           | What it means                                                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `script.js`    | Look in the current folder                                     |
| `./script.js`  | Start in the current folder, go to `script.js`                |
| `../script.js` | Go **one folder up**, then find `script.js`                   |
| `/script.js`   | Go to the **root folder of the server**, not your local folder |

```html
<script src="./script.js"></script>
```

This one is standard and preferred to use. You're telling the browser: "Hey browser, go to the current folder (part7), and from there, open script.js."

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

It means the same thing, because the browser already looks in the current folder by default.

So in this case: âœ… `script.js` = `./script.js`

## Script Tag Placement

Now where should be place the script tag there are different ways and through that we can differ loading:
- Actually it can be placed in head section
- In body section at the top (maybe you want button)
- In body section at the last

It depends on when you want your JS executable part to be loaded like for example if you want a button to be immediately available to click then obviously I will load that executable part in the head.

```html
<script defer src="./script.js"></script>
```

We can even write keywords like "defer" to tell the browser that JavaScript can be loaded later or you can differ the loading when it feels to like.

But we have a strong problem that is web element manipulation (flow chart in notebook).

## Web Element Manipulation - Window > BOM

```javascript
console.log(window);
```

So this will show us what actually this window object contains and you can see that it has a lot of properties and methods and you can see that by inspect > dev tools > console. This way you can access the screen navigator location basically BOM part of it but yes it has DOM also and they are not ripped apart.

In console you can just test out `window.outerWidth` and `window.outerHeight` and it gives exact width and height of the browser window - this comes under screen object.

### Navigator Object

Navigator object can be used and the most common you would be using is the userAgent property:

```javascript
console.log(navigator.userAgent);
```

This will give you the user agent string which is a string that contains information about the browser and operating system.

**Output:** `Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 16_6 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/16.6 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1 Edg/138.0.0.0`

Search for navigator MDN and you will see it has so many properties like cookieEnabled, geolocation, pdfViewerEnabled, plugins, and so on and these are basically web APIs that are available in the browser and you can use them to get information about the browser and the device.

### Location Object

Location object obviously has ton of APIs and use them to find out like:

```javascript
console.log(location.hostname);
console.log(location.href);
```

Search for location MDN and there are also crazy amount of properties and methods that you can use to manipulate the URL and get information about the current page.

## DOM Manipulation

Now this part was basically BOM and JavaScript we already studied now comes DOM and turns out in every single JS we have this element.

Every element is just like a tree. Now we want to study how can I access these tags buttons and different elements. Currently I have only one children that is h1 tag and now I will access this element through DOM.

```javascript
console.log(document)
```

See what this document contains on console.

```javascript
console.log(document.getElementsByTagName("h1"));
```

We can extract the text content of the first h1 element called "innertext" and also there is some property innerHTML.

Study about these APIs all that BOM and DOM has.

## Event Listeners

Learn about all kinds of event listeners by searching events in JS MDN. Just like we have `add(2,3)` like 2 parameters, the event listeners also takes 2 parameters one is what it is has to perform and the other is for functionality (yes it takes a function - a higher order function).

We use higher order functions only we don't use arrow functions because when we call `console.log(this)` inside the function then on console on clicking the button this keyword gives current context that is the change button context who is calling it. But if we call `console.log(this)` using arrow function then this keyword context is window object it points to global this and not the current one. So for these event listeners higher order functions are helpful.

## DOM vs HTML

DOM and HTML are different:
- **HTML** is a markup language
- **DOM** is processed elements in document tree in memory

Whatever you do in your markup language that piece of code is taken by browser and then browser internally runs C++ and through that a document tree is generated in the memory and, that tree is DOM.

## Website Manipulation Example

Now we go to any website and can make our own changes. Demonstration on console:

```javascript
document.getElementsByTagName("h1");
// HTMLCollection [h1]
```

We can't use `.textContent` just like we used for `getElementById`, sometimes we would be getting a collection sometimes a node list and here `[h1]` is actually array, we can verify it by:

```javascript
document.getElementsByTagName("h1").length;
// 1

document.getElementsByTagName("h1")[0];
// <h1>InputEvent</h1>

document.getElementsByTagName("h1")[0].textContent;
// "InputEvent"

document.getElementsByTagName("h1")[0].textContent = "Chaicode";
// "Chaicode"
// This is changed on the website also
```

Now let's test out on `<a>` tags:

```javascript
let anchorElements = document.getElementsByTagName("a");
// undefined

anchorElements
// HTMLCollection[138]
// 138 <a> tags being used on website page

for(let index = 0; index < 15; index++){
    console.log(anchorElements[index].textContent);
}
// Gives all 15 links textContent
```

This is how you do web scrapping also. So basically on a website we get HTMLCollections but sometimes there are node list which looks like an array but not an array, it needs to be converted into an array to perform
