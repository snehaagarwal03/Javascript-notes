there are 2 ways for import and export: ES6 Modules and CommonJS. CommonJS is mainly used in Node.js and ES6 Modules is used in modern JavaScript applications, especially in the browser.
In ES6 Modules, we can export functions, objects, or any other values from a module using the `export` keyword. We can then import these exports in another module using the `import` keyword.
In CommonJS, we use `module.exports` to export values and `require()` to import them. This is the traditional way of handling modules in Node.js.
In ES6 Modules, we can also use `export default` to export a single value as the default export of a module. This allows us to import it without using curly braces.
In CommonJS, we can export a single value using `module.exports` and import it using `require()` without curly braces. This is similar to the `export default` syntax in ES6 Modules.
ES6 Modules are static, meaning they are resolved at compile time, while CommonJS modules are dynamic, meaning they are resolved at runtime. This allows for better tree-shaking and optimization in ES6 Modules.
ES6 Modules support asynchronous loading, which allows for better performance in modern applications. CommonJS    modules are synchronous, meaning they block the execution of code until the module is loaded.
ES6 Modules are the future of JavaScript modules, and they are widely supported in modern browsers and JavaScript environments. CommonJS is still widely used in Node.js and older JavaScript applications, but ES6 Modules are becoming the standard for new projects.
To use ES6 Modules, we need to ensure that our JavaScript environment supports them. Most modern browsers and JavaScript environments support ES6 Modules natively, but if we are using an older environment or need to support older browsers, we can use tools like Babel to transpile our code to ES5 syntax.
In conclusion, ES6 Modules are the recommended way to handle modules in modern JavaScript applications.
