let gameName = "spiderman";

// reassigning the value
gameName = "superman";
console.log(gameName);

const username = "sneha03";
username = "sneha";
// this line will give error as assignment to a constant variable is not allowed

// we use const mostly in projects as we want to have relibility in our code that once we have defined anything its permanent and we don't want to change it
